# Neural_Networks-Deep_Learning_Models:




## Background:


In this challenge,Build your own machine learning model that will be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. Your trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company—only those projects likely to be a success will receive any future funding from Alphabet Soup.



## Objectives:


The goals of this challenge :

*  Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset.


*  Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing.


*  Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.




## Resources:

* csv

*  jupyter notebook

* Neural_Networks-Deep_Learning_Models

## Challenge_summary:


For Analysis, I created a new Jupyter Notebook as “AlphabetSoupChallenge.ipynb.I  did import and characterize the input data.Used the methods for  preprocess all numerical and categorical variables, as needed as
Combine rare categorical values via bucketing,Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding,Standardize numerical variables using Scikit-Learn’s StandardScaler class.I uesd a TensorFlow  Deep neural network.I did Compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model. And found some model loss metric,model predictive accuracy.


For Analysis,I used Deep neural net with First hidden layer ,second hidden layer and output layer.I used relu  activation for first&second layer and sigmiod activation for output layer.based on that I got  around 53% Accuracy.For incrase accuracy of  model,I used  first hidden layer with 32 and second hidden layer with 16.I got around 53% accuracy.And then I did try with different hidden layer and different epchos.I used first hidden with 24 &second hidden layer with 12 and 50 epochs.Based on that I got around 72 % Accuary.


Based on Analysis, I would to like choose last model for  solve this classification problem.
